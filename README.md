**Please do NOT use this *master* branch, instead, please refer to *ansible* branch.**
https://github.com/ctrautma/RHEL_NIC_QUALIFICATION/tree/ansible

The command to clone ansible branch only is:
```
$git clone -b ansible --single-branch https://github.com/ctrautma/RHEL_NIC_QUALIFICATION.git
```
Thanks!
